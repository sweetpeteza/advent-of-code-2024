# Day 6

You offer to help, but first you need to understand the structure of these
towers. You ask each program to yell out their name, their weight, and (if
they're holding a disc) the names of the programs immediately above them
balancing on that disc. You write this information down (your puzzle input).
Unfortunately, in their panic, they don't do this in an orderly fashion; by the
time you're done, you're not sure which program gave which information.

For example, if your list is the following:

```
pbga (66)
xhth (57)
ebii (61)
havc (66)
ktlj (57)
fwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth
qoyq (66)
padx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq
tknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft
jptl (61)
ugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl
gyxo (61)
cntj (57)
```

...then you would be able to recreate the structure of the towers that looks
like this:

```
                gyxo
              /
         ugml - ebii
       /      \
      |         jptl
      |
      |         pbga
     /        /
tknk --- padx - havc
     \        \
      |         qoyq
      |
      |         ktlj
       \      /
         fwft - cntj
              \
                xhth
```

# Answer

The answer is calculated by keeping track of all parents and all children, then
comparing to see which parent is not also a child.

# Running

The solution is written in golang and takes a list from stdin, printing the
answer on EOF (`C-d` on OSX).

```go
âžœ go run main.go
pbga (66)
xhth (57)
ebii (61)
havc (66)
ktlj (57)
fwft (72) -> ktlj, cntj, xhth
qoyq (66)
padx (45) -> pbga, havc, qoyq
tknk (41) -> ugml, padx, fwft
jptl (61)
ugml (68) -> gyxo, ebii, jptl
gyxo (61)
cntj (57)
head node: `tknk`
```
